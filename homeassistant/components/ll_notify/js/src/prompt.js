/**
 * NOT IMPLEMENTED
 *
 * Not currently implemented. For this to be valuable, it would need to pass the return
 * value from the frontend to the backend, and then the backend would need to use that
 * value.
 *
 * It's complicated enough that I worry this would not be very useful, it could cause
 * unexpected challenges, and there would be better ways to solve end-user goals.
 *
 * Rather than start down this path without clear use cases, I'm going to stop and
 * only implement if it becomes clear it is worth it.
 *
 * Potential problems:
 *  1. Would have to send value from front to back and back to front.
 *     Usually this would be null and ugly.
 *  2. Would you need validation? Would it be useful without?
 *  3. Would there be a better way to do this with scripts, different event_data, etc?
